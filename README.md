# File System in C

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of a Unixv6-like file system in C, developed as part of a system-oriented programming course. Inspired by the UnixV6 project, it delves into various aspects of file system management, including inodes, directory structures, and file manipulation, demonstrating a deep understanding of low-level system programming.

## Key Features
- **Inode Management**: Setting up and listing inodes, writing inodes, and managing small files.
- **SHA Calculation**: Implemented for verifying file integrity.
- **Directory and Filesystem Operations**: Handling directory structures and implementing essential file operations.
- **Bitmap Vectors**: Utilized for efficient management of storage blocks.
- **FUSE Integration**: Mounting the filesystem using FUSE for a real Unix-like experience.
- **Final Compilation and Integration**: Comprehensive testing and integration of all features.

## Project Phases
- **Initial Setup**: Setting up the inodes and basic file system structure.
- **Directory Management**: Implementing directory creation, listing, and traversal.
- **Final Testing**: Integration and thorough testing to ensure full functionality.

## Contributing
This project was developed as part of the EPFL curriculum. Special thanks to **EPFL** for the project guidelines and to **Temi Messmer**, my teammate, for their invaluable contributions throughout the development process.
